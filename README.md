# Contact Center Scorecard 🚀

Welcome to the **Contact Center Scorecard** project! This repository is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) (bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/create-next-app)) and features an integrated [Strapi](https://strapi.io) backend. It provides a comprehensive dashboard for contact centers to monitor performance and key metrics.

## Overview ✨

The **Contact Center Scorecard** offers an intuitive interface to view, manage, and analyze contact center performance. With Next.js powering the frontend and Strapi managing the backend content, you get a robust and scalable solution.

## Getting Started 🚀

### Starting the Next.js Frontend

1. **Install Dependencies**  
   Ensure you have installed all necessary packages:

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   # or
   pnpm install
   # or
   bun install

   ```

2. **Run the Development Server**
   Start the Next.js development server:

npm run dev

# or

yarn dev

# or

pnpm dev

# or

bun dev

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to see your app in action. 🎉

3. Edit Your Pages
   Begin editing by modifying files in the pages/ directory (e.g., pages/index.js). The app auto-refreshes as you save your changes.

**Starting the Strapi Backend**
1 . Navigate to the Strapi Directory
Open a terminal and switch to your Strapi backend folder:

cd backend

2. Install Backend Dependencies
   If you haven’t installed Strapi’s dependencies yet, run:

npm install

# or

yarn install

3. Launch Strapi
   Start the Strapi development server:

npm run develop

# or

yarn develop

Your Strapi backend will now be available at http://localhost:1337, and the admin panel at http://localhost:1337/admin. 🔥

**Development Workflow 🛠️**
Editing Pages:
Update pages in the pages/ directory. The app supports hot-reloading for rapid development.

API Routes:
Access API endpoints at http://localhost:3000/api/hello. Modify these in pages/api/hello.js.

Content Management:
Manage your content through the Strapi admin panel, where you can configure data types and API endpoints.

This project also leverages next/font for automatic font optimization and loading.
